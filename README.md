notes for my time at MIT!

# Introduction 

Hello! My name is Andrew Pham, and as of May, 2025, I am currently a physics major in the class of 2028 at MIT. If you found this page, then that's cool. I'll probably try and post my notes in classes that I'll take here, so let's hope I can remember to take good notes and actually post them :)
